### An Elixir module that can be added to your project to parse incoming email

Copy the module to your project and use it as needed: [email_reply_parser.ex](email_reply_parser.ex)

```elixir
# Returns the email body stripped with just the new email
EmailReplayParser.remove_original_email("email_body") 
```
